# **Welcome to the webpage of the Cersonsky Lab!**

The Cersonsky Lab broadly focuses on understanding the interplay between molecular and materials structure and properties, drawing concepts and techniques from crystallography and molecular simulation. We research ways to numerically encode anisotropy and develop methods and software to efficiently incorporate complex, multiscale interactions into numerical simulation and machine learning models. 

Right now we are in the process of starting up and are prioritizing our science (and therefore this webpage is threadbare).
