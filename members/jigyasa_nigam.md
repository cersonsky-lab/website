**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**\
Collaborator & Visitor

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: 
* Understanding the role of physical symmetries in atomistic ML, equivariant message-passing representations and networks   
* (This goes without saying :)) Working on finishing my PhD at the COSMO Lab (EPFL) 

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: 
* I was the first visitor at the Cersonsky Lab in March 2023! 
* I've done a [lot of work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9SQo-l0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on atom-centered machine learning formalisms, you should check it out!
