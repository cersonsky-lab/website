# ** Seungmin (Henry) Lee (2023 - present)**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: I'm currently working on Crystal structure with Sas using the MPB module, an invented module to find photonic band gaps in a crystal structure.

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: I'm trying to find gaps in the "diamond" structure depending on epsilon. 

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: I've done with getting information about some crystals and using them, I plotted the Atlas gaps of them.


<!-- If you have photos you would like to exhibit,
     save them as `/assets/member_images/your_name_photo_#.png`
     and replace example_student below -->
