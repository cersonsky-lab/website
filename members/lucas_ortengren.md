# **Lucas Ortengren (2023 - present)**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: Documentation-writer and miscellaneous assistant.

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: Learning the ins and outs of AniSOAP and machine learning. I'm also interested in computational topology and its applications to chemistry.

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: I've previously done research about Heesch numbers and aperiodic monotiles as part of the Madison Experimental Mathematics lab! Check out the picture below, an 8-kite with Heesch number 2 that I helped discover.

<!-- If you have photos you would like to exhibit,
     save them as `/assets/member_images/your_name_photo_#.png`
     and replace example_student below -->
