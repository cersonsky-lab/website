# Caleb Youngwerth (2023 - present)

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**\
I'm working with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/members/hwigwang_lim">Hwigwang Lim</a> to use molecular simulations to model a modified DLVO potential with gels in an effort to make better batteries.

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**\
Molecular simulation, LAMMPS, gels, music, summer

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**\
I've gotten some working molecular dynamics simulations completed, created many organizational scripts for job submission, and learned a lot about the DLVO potential. I've also learned a lot about presenting scientific work and how to best do that. I even won the <a href="https://awards.advising.wisc.edu/campus-wide-award-recipients/sophomore-research-fellows/">Sophomore Research Fellowship</a> in Spring 2024 for my work thus far on the project. With this fellowship, I got to present at the APS-Eastern Great Lakes Section biannual meeting for Fall 2024 in Marietta, Ohio, where I won the undergraduate poster award for the meeting! For some more information about that trip and my research, check out the <a href="https://engineering.wisc.edu/blog/student-wins-award-for-research-on-colloidal-gels/">article</a> published by the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Also traveling around the state and the country with the marching band is pretty cool too.
