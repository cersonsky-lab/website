<!-- Replace `Example Student` with your name and include your start date-->
# **Yong-Cheol Cho (2023 - present)**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: I use my computer science knowledge and try to apply to the field of chemical engineering.

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: Working on computational chemistry (anisoap) that combines two majors that I am studying.

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: 
* I play piano as a hobby.
* I sometimes code during my spare time (like a simulator for double pendulums on the second picture)
* I also enjoy playing games that tests my ability to think (like the one on the third picture, which took me hours to figure out).

<!-- If you have photos you would like to exhibit,
     save them as `/assets/member_images/your_name_photo_#.png`
     and replace example_student below -->
