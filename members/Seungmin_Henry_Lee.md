# **Seungmin Lee (Henry) (2023 - present)**

<!-- Choose your title -- feel free to be professionally silly -->
**Role in the Cersonsky Lab**: I'm working on nanoparticle project, specifically PBG(Photonic Band Gaps). It is predicting the photonic behavior of many crystals.

<!-- Name at least one research topic amongst this list -->
**Things I'm excited about right now**: Recycling plastic, reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 

<!-- Ultimately, we'll use this section to
     include papers and talks, and contributions
     But for now put whatever you want -->
**Cool stuff I've done**: I helped build this website. I can make a gap atlas, which is the plot showing the band gap depending on the radius at a specific epsilon.


<!-- If you have photos you would like to exhibit,
     save them as `/assets/member_images/your_name_photo_#.png`
     and replace example_student below -->
