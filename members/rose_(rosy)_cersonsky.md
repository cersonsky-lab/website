**Cool stuff I've done**:
Professionally? I've <a href="https://www.github.com/rosecers">written some good code</a>, published <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B2cyV70AAAAJ&hl=en">some cool papers</a>, given lots of talks, and <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/2021colloids/victor-k-lamer-award/">won a few awards</a>. 

Outside of the lab, I love to run, climb, bake, and be in the outdoors!
