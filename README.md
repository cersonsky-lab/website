## Adding your page to the website
1. Begin by cloning the repository to your local computer. You can do this by clicking the green `<> code` button above, copying the URL to your clipboard, and then executing `git clone link` in the terminal in which you paste the link in place of the word `link` in your desired local directory.
2. In the terminal, travel to the website directory. Remain there for the rest of the instructions. Create a new branch by executing `git checkout -b your_name_branch` in the terminal.
3. Add your name to `members.txt` (by running `nano members.txt` in the terminal) under the appropriate category in alphabetic order by last name. Type your name _exactly_ how you would like it to show up in the directory, followed by a dash ' - ' and your GitHub username.
4. Execute `cp members/example_student.md members/your_name.md` in terminal where `your_name` is the name you wrote in (3), but lowercase and with '_' instead of spaces. This will create a file `members/your_name.md` that is an exact copy of `members/example_student.md`.
5. Fill out `members/your_name.md`! Access the file by executing `nano members/your_name.md` and make sure to replace all instances of `example student` with your name. 
6. Add a professional photo (preferably square aspect ratio) at `assets/img/your_name.png`. This can be done manually on the cumputer desktop or by executing `cp /path/to/source/your_name.png ./assets/img`, where `/path/to/source` is the path to where the image is on your computer.
7. Add any extra photos (research, hobbies, etc.) at `assets/img/your_name_#.png`, where `#` is a number 1-3. If you choose not to do this, comment out the table in `members/your_name.md`.
8. Run `make_member_page.py` and check that there are no errors.
9. Preview your webpage by calling `bundle install; bundle exec jekyll serve`.
    9a. This step may not work if you do not have _Jekyll_ installed correctly or installed in general on your computer. To fix this, the first step is to install _Ruby_ through a version manager. Do this by running `brew install rbenv`, then run `rbenv init`, and then restart your terminal and return to the website directory. The second step is to run `gem install jekyll`, and the problem will be solved.
    9b. Another reason this step may not work is because your version of _Ruby_ is not compatible with the bundler that generatreed the _Gemfile.loc_ file (`1.17.2`). Begin by seeing if this is the issue by executing `ruby -v` in the terminal. If any number is displayed that is higher than 2.6.10, then an older version of _Ruby_ must be downloaded. Do this by executing `rbenv install 2.6.10`, then `rbenv global 2.6.10`, and finally `ruby -v` to verify version 2.6.10 of _Ruby_ is now installed.
    9c. Once the command is succesfully ran, copy and paste the provided URL into your browser and verify everything on the website is how you want it to look.
10. Commit your branch and push it to the repository with `git add *; git commit -m "Making a page for your name"; git push origin your_name_branch`.
11. Create a pull request on `https://github.com/cersonsky-lab/website/pulls` and check that all tests run.
12. Request one of your group members and Rosy (@rosecers) as a reviewer.
