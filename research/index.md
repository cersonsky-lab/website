# Our Research Philosophies
The Cersonsky group is interested in leveraging data science and molecular simulation to explore molecular systems with changing and complex phase behavior. This research aims to address pertinent fundamental and applied open problems in computational chemical and materials sciences, all to better our world. Our group is committed to conducting research that upholds the principles of open science and adheres to [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data standards.

# Areas of Interest
<strong>Machine Learning</strong>
In recent years, machine learning has been used to successfully model atomic-level chemical phenomena, allowing much larger systems to be accurately analyzed.
However, connecting atomic level behaviors to larger scale mesoscopic structures and macroscopic phase behavior is still a challenge.
In the Cersonsky group, we are developing machine learning techniques to bridge this gap between the atomic and the macroscopic.

<strong>Molecular Simulation</strong>
Molecular dynamics is a powerful technique to sample atomic and molecular structures based on single particle properties.

We are interested in using simulation to understand how atomic interactions create microscopic structures, and how these structures affect phase behavior.

<strong>Chemistry as Data</strong>
Converting chemical information into data for computational analysis is a non-trivial process.
We are working to develop and apply data scientific techniques to retain as much chemistry in as little data as possible.
