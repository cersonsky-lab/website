**The Cersonsky Lab is often recruiting post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate researchers to join our team.**

We look for candidates that are enthusiastic, motivated, creative and independent, with an attitude for critical thinking.
We consider diverse scientific backgrounds at the doctoral level, while hiring at the post-doctoral level tends to be more focused.

Please consider that in order to perform a preliminary screening, all the inquiries that do not follow these guidelines might be silently ignored.

### Postdoctoral researchers
